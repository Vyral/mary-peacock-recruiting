<p>Dear Future or Current Real Esta</p>te Agent,

<p>It is so stifling to work in a job that lacks opportunities for growth and advancement. I’ve been there before—juggling hundreds of different tasks all by myself, without coaching o</p>r a team to back me up.

<p>When you stretch yourself so thin, how could you possibly give your clients the level of service they deserve? Perhaps you lay awake at night, wondering how you’ll make ends meet and where your next leads will come from. You could always buy your own leads, but is spending money on your job worth it if you’re not doing enough business to provide for yourself or your family? You might also bounce from brokerage to brokerage, hoping that each one will have the answers to your problems. If this is the case, you might be considering leaving real estate altogether.</p>

<p>Around 87% of real estate agents fail in their first two years. The average solo agent sells four homes in their first year, and often don’t make enough to exceed the poverty line.</p>

<p>But that can all change for you, if you accept the offer I’m proposing: Join the Peacock Real Estate Team.</p>

<p>Eight years ago, I was a solo agent. I know the struggles of having an impossible workload and little or no help to tackle it all. But I felt that there was a better way to do things. </p>

<p>I needed help with each aspect of the transaction, so I developed a team of specialized agents. Each would work in a specific area and hone their skills there, allowing us to divide the workload between us and to give clients high-quality service. Our buyer specialists take care of the clients on the buy side; our listing agents handle the sellers’ needs; and our awesome admin staff work on the paperwork and contracts on the back end.</p>

<p>I’m not offering you a magical solution to your problems; our team-oriented process and environment are proven to work. Just read what one of our team members has to say about making the switch:</p>

<p class="indent">“I love working at Peacock Real Estate because of the team aspect. It makes the most of what not only I can do but the rest of the team also. It was the best career choice I could have made for myself and Mary made it very easy for me to make the move and do it quickly. I've learned a lot since my start in the company and Real Estate in general and I'm looking forward to continuing the journey for many years to come.”</p>

<p>Other brokerages may not use this structure, but it’s their loss. Joining our team would only be your gain.</p>


<p>A position on the Peacock Team will provide you with:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Full-time hours</li>
<li>A variable schedule</li>
<li>A graduating split ranging from anywhere between 40% and 50%</li>
<li>The support of a skilled team who all work to make your job easier and your clients happier</li>
</ul></p>

<p>When you join the team, you’ll work with me personally for a period of 30, 60, or 90 days, during which time I’ll coach you through all the processes and systems you’ll need to know in order to be successful.</p>

<p>However, this offer will not last forever. Team Peacock hires for quality, not quantity, so positions are limited. That means if you’re ready to make a change, you should absolutely apply now.</p>

<p>Of course, you could always go back to a traditional brokerage, where you may or may not have the support you need, where you have to buy your own leads, or where you juggle hundreds of tasks all day. Or, you could just leave the industry altogether and take up a passionless 9-to-5 job.</p>

<p>It’s ultimately up to you, but if you’ve made it this far, something tells me that you don’t want those things. You want a team that lifts you up and helps you be the best you can be for yourself, your family, and your clients.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about my offer, my team, or the position, I’ll be happy to receive your phone call or email.</p> 

<p>I hope to hear from you soon,</p>
