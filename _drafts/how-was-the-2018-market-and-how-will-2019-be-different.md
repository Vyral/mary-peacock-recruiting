2018 is finally over, which means it’s time to review our market’s performance over the course of the year. Interest rates rose steadily in 2018, while, on the other hand, inventory saw a considerable drop.

There will still be a number of opportunities for buyers this year, but the present window of opportunity is one you shouldn’t pass up.
