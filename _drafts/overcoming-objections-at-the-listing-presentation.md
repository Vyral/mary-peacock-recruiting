During the listing presentation, you’ll show your homeowners all the ways you’ll market the property, and explain why they should list their home with you. They listen attentively and nod their heads. All is going smoothly until you ask them to sign the listing agreement….<br>…and suddenly, there are a dozen reasons why they won’t sign right now. What went wrong?

<br>In most cases, nothing\! The sellers may not be ready to commit, despite having the motivation to sell.

<br>This is where agents can lose their new clients right off the bat – by not listening to them, and by failing to ask them the right questions. &nbsp;**Treat every objection as an opportunity to offer specific information and guidance.**

<br>A few rational objections or seller concerns are perfectly normal. If your client is not ready to commit to listing their home, it’s often because they do not have confidence in their decision. This means they need more information from you, or about you\!

<br>**Indecision = the need for more information.**&nbsp;

<br>In most cases, the client wants to move forward, but needs assurances on certain fronts. If you help them develop confidence in you, and in your knowledge and abilities, the signatures will soon follow.

<br>Clients may also resist the idea of selling their home for emotional reasons. Even if it’s in their best interests to sell, leaving a home full of memories can be very difficult\! These clients need patience and compassion – and help keeping their goals in sight.

<br>**Here are 5 tips to keep objections to a minimum:**<br>**1\. Learn your client’s motivation to sell.** The stronger their reasons for selling, the more manageable the objections are likely to be. Identify the obstacles and explain how you’ll solve them.&nbsp;<br>**2\. Learn the client’s deadlines, and help them create a timetable for action.** Do they want to move before winter weather? Do they need to be settled in before the school year begins? How long are homes like theirs spending on the market? How long will it take to close after an offer is accepted?&nbsp;<br>Explain what the timeline looks like for their home type, price range and local market, and use it to show why “time is of the essence.”&nbsp;<br>**3\. When more than one homeowner is involved in the sales decision, one seller may be more motivated than the other.** Ask questions about their future home plans to determine each party’s motivations. One spouse might be excited to move closer to family, but the other may be less enthused. Try to discover where their mutual motivation exists for selling. Help them visualize their new lifestyle.&nbsp;<br>**4\. Set the expectation to move forward.** Remind your clients that by obtaining a market analysis and consultation, the thought of selling was already in their minds. They can wait if they wish, but they will be risking changes in market conditions and local home values\! Such changes can affect them on the selling side, and the buyer side, and alter the entire picture\!<br>**5\. Be the one-stop solution.** Your marketing plan, your professional resources and your local network is unlike any other. Let your clients know that you’ll help them through every step of the home selling process, and that you’ll resolve any questions or issues that come up along the way. You are a go-getter and a problem solver\!

<br>Now, let’s talk about the top **3 home seller objections.** These are the most common objections you are likely to hear at the listing presentation. I’ve included a short script you can use to handle each one\!

<br>**1\.** My home isn’t ready for the market.&nbsp;<br>Answer:<br>“Not all updates give you a good return on investment. Your home can be sold as-is, or with minor touch-ups, which will save you considerable time and money\! This will also make your home very competitive on the market, as you won’t have to price in expensive upgrades.”&nbsp;

<br>**2\.** The sales commission is too high.<br>Answer:<br>“The sales commission is shared between my brokerage and the buyer’s brokerage, and each side of the transaction has numerous professional expenses that are deducted from it. This includes MLS fees, Errors and Omissions insurance, digital and print media budgeting, office costs, travel expenses, Internet and cell phone expenses, and so on. The smaller the commission, the smaller the slices of pie, and the less motivation agents will have to show your property\!”

<br>**3\.** We have a friend/relative in the real estate business.&nbsp;<br>Answer:<br>“Wonderful\! You may find it insightful to ask them the same questions you asked me. But what happens if they fail to sell your home, or if something goes wrong in the transaction? There is a lot of money at stake, and not everyone can mix business with a personal relationship. You may want to help your friend by giving them your business, but doing so can put your home sale, and your friendship, at risk.”

<br>**One more bit of advice: a homeowner who has numerous objections, and who doesn’t seem inclined to accept any solution, is a fight that isn’t worth having.** This type of client isn’t ready to sell – or, they may not be comfortable with you at the wheel, for whatever reason. Do not take it personally. Give them your handout materials, thank them for their time, and wish them success. There will be other opportunities\!&nbsp;<br>We’ve just scratched the surface with these examples, and there is so much more I could tell you\!
