Our second annual Backpack for Kids event is coming up on August 4 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at [Peacock Real Estate](https://www.searchmidmichiganhomes.com/){: target="_blank"}\: 18030 3 Mile Rd, Morley, MI 49336, and we’d love for you to join us. This is our way of giving back to the community, and we’re also inviting people to make donations—our goal is to donate 200 backpacks to the students at Morley Stanwood Community Schools. If you have any questions about this event, don’t hesitate to call or email me. If you have a backpack to donate, just drop it off at our office—we’re open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. We look forward to seeing you there.
