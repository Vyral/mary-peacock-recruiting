I’m often asked if it’s better to work as an individual agent or with a team, so I’d like to share my insight on this topic with you today.

When you work alone, you’re stuck juggling a multitude of tasks. **But with a team, there are members who specialize in specific areas**, such as marketing or home closings. There’s a whole team at your disposal who will cover the behind-the-scenes work while you’re out there doing what you do best: helping clients buy or sell homes.

And with this support, you don’t need to be at the beck and call of your clients 24/7—**in fact, you could even go on a vacation if you wanted!** There’s simply no way you could do so if you were the only point of contact for your clients.

I certainly believe that joining a team is the best option for agents, whether they’re new to the industry or have been working in it for years. If you have any questions or would like further information, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
