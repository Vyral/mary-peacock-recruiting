To get your home ready to sell this summer, there are some things you should do to prepare it. First, make sure you declutter. You’re going to be moving anyway, so pack things away in storage. Then you’ll want to hire a handyman to do some minor repairs or painting around the home. I also recommend that you spruce up your landscaping out front to make it more inviting for buyers. Finally, think about staging your home so that buyers can see themselves living in it. If you have any questions for me or want some more tips about getting your home ready for sale, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
