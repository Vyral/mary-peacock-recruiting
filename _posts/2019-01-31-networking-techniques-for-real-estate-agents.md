<br>You have your new real estate license in hand, but nobody in your current sphere of influence is ready to buy or sell. Now what?

Now it’s time to NETWORK. In person. There’s a right way and a wrong way to network. Let’s talk about the wrong way first.

The wrong way to network involves scattering business cards around local coffee shops and pressing them into the palm of every casual acquaintance. This random distribution, which is about as efficient as dropping your business cards from an airplane and praying someone picks one up, is a waste of time and cardstock. It makes you look desperate.

**Despite what you may have been told, real estate is not a “numbers game.” It’s about people and relationships.&nbsp;**

This doesn’t mean that cold-calling and door-knocking shouldn’t be done. But you shouldn’t do it with the simple goal of handing out your name and contact info. Odds are, most everything you’ve been told about networking is wrong, or at least ineffective and inefficient.&nbsp;

When you hand out your business card, what information are you getting in return? This is for many new agents, the answer is nothing! Because you’ve been nervous about handing out business cards and hoping people accept them. You’ve been focused entirely on you.&nbsp;

**Ready for the right way to network in person? This is big, and crazy-easy:**

Don’t hand out business cards. Collect them instead. In other words, obtain the contact information of the person you are speaking to. Tell them you’d like to keep in touch and ask them for a business card, an email address, a phone number, a social media connection, etc.

If you get their phone number, add it to your phone contacts immediately. If they give you an email address, send a test message from your smartphone right then and there (something like, “Hello! Nice to meet you!”). Do the same for any social media follows; connect right there.&nbsp;

Of course, if they ask for your business card, thank them for asking, and hand it to them!&nbsp;

The best scenario is if they add you to their phone contacts or social media connections immediately. One way to accomplish this is to “not have any business cards with you.” Apologize for not having a card on you at the moment – but invite them to put your number in their phone while you’re there. It’s a little sneaky, but it makes you harder to forget!

**Bonus step!** During your conversation, you should have soaked up a few personal details about the other person. Things like: Are they single or married? Kids or pets? Business owner, manager, or employee? Long-time resident or new in town? Renter or homeowner? Favorite restaurant? What do you have in common with the other person?&nbsp;

Once you have left the presence of your new contact, immediately jot down as many details as you can remember about them. Use your favorite app or send yourself an email message. You can write it on the back of their business card. Whatever works for you!&nbsp;

Later that day, be sure to update your contact database with all of your new prospects and their contact information.&nbsp;

**Until you’re busy with listing appointments, showings, and closings, networking and prospecting will be your daily priority.**

I’ll cover more aspects of networking when I post about building your sphere of influence, using scripts, and staying top of mind! In the meantime, if you’re not sure what to say to people when networking, just ask me! I’ll personally share some pointers.
