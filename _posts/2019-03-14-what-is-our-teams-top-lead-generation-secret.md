**Identify Your Sphere of Influence! (Building your first contact list)&nbsp;**

Ever hear the expression, “It’s not what you know, it’s *who* you know?” When you’re a new real estate agent, this is somewhat true! While a real estate career involves many skills, this business is all about helping people.

As a new agent, you’ll start by offering to help people you already know! Social media makes building your contact list easy. You’re probably connected to hundreds of people already!

**But first, decide *where* and *how* you’re going keep this contact list, because your business launch depends on it.&nbsp;**

You can use a [contact app](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5891-5-iphone-apps-to-manage-your-business-contacts.html), or if you prefer, you can use an Excel or Numbers spreadsheet. Microsoft Outlook or Gmail works great too!

Whatever method you choose, it should be easy to access, edit and update. In the near future, you’ll be importing this data into a CRM database. (Client Relationship Management system.)

Your list should include:

* Name of contact
* How you know them
* Email address
* Mailing address
* Phone number

You may need to jog your memory at times. When you find yourself running out of names, starting thinking in terms of categories:

* Relatives
* Friends from high school/college
* People you know from school groups – sports, band, theater
* Former co-workers
* Neighbors
* People in your church, volunteer group, book club
* Professional acquaintances – doctors, lawyers, plumbers, bankers
* Other people you do business with on a regular basis

Once your list is done, you may find that the contact information is sketchy in some cases. Do a little homework! Google search your contact names and look for corresponding street addresses. Check social media profiles for more information.

By now, you’re already realizing how valuable good information is, up front!

Once your contact list is solid, sort it by how well you know people. This gives you the ability to approach people a little differently, based on the strength of your relationship with them.

Now for the fun part. Go through your contact list one more time. Identify people who are currently renters, or homeowners, if you happen to know this detail.

* Your contact list of renters is now your home buyer prospect list.
* Your contact list of homeowners is now your home seller prospect list.

You’ll still contact everyone at least once - but now you can customize some of your messages to suit the recipient!

**Do’s and Don’ts of contacting people as a new agent:**

**Don’t:** Typical advice to new agents goes something like this: “Send a career announcement postcard to everyone you know, telling them you’re in real estate!”

And you’ll get a resounding whoop-de-doo from the vast majority.

Rare is the person who will step forward and volunteer to be your very first home seller, just to help you out. They stand to lose big if you mess up. So if you want people to avoid you like a telemarketer, tell them you’re new in real estate and look desperate for business.

**Exception:** If you already had a connection to the real estate business or another pertinent background, a new career announcement could make total sense. If you’ve been a real estate investor, mortgage broker, home stager, financial advisor or similar professional, you may enjoy instant credibility.

Also, if you have a highly recognized name in your community, your announcement may be of local interest and newsworthy, and therefore well-received.

There are no hard and fast rules about real estate career announcements. **However, keep in mind that once your announcement has identified you as a “newbie,” you could spend a lot of time, energy and marketing money trying to overcome that impression.**

Because of this, I usually recommend a different approach.

**DO:** The best strategy often begins with offering valuable information to your contacts, right out of the gate! You can access this info through your MLS and through public sources.

Why send a postcard saying, “Hello, I’m a new agent!” …

When you can say something like, “Hey, I know a LOT about what’s happening in our real estate market, and because you know me, you’ve got an advantage!”
