Most of your business will come from online sources, and many people simply won’t answer the phone. Along with a phone call and leaving a voicemail, you should be texting your leads; **sending a video in your text is even better.** If you send a video, they’ll see your face and associate it with your name, which leaves a great impression and helps you stand out from all the other real estate agents calling them. I hope this little tip helps.
