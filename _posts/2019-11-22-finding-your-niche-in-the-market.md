You often hear about “finding your niche” from industry gurus. This is because the real estate market is absolutely saturated with agents, and you need to create distinction in your brand. The National Association of REALTORS claims an official membership roster of 1,406,438 agents as of October 2019. And because not every licensed agent is a member of NAR, the actual number of agents is much higher.

When you add the industry disruptors that are working to replace agents in the buying or selling process, the future of traditional real estate agents seems murky.&nbsp;

It’s a fact that technology will affect how and when consumers seek an agent. It’s also a fact that the barrier to entry for new agents is relatively low, and there are fresh students in the pipeline year after year. For these reasons, you will always face competition for your market, your clients and your commission.&nbsp;

**Examples of a market niche**

Fortunately, there are a number of ways to distinguish yourself from other agents. These include:

**Location/Market specialties**. This includes specific neighborhoods, regional areas, school districts, vacation areas, lakefront properties, hunting and fishing hotspots, urban cores, or any other place that you have a depth of knowledge about. Your market specialty can be as broad or as targeted as you’d like, but be certain you have the expertise to back it up.

**Home Type specialties.**&nbsp;This includes condominiums and townhomes, active-adult communities, luxury homes, starter homes, hobby farms, new construction, vacation homes and so on.&nbsp;

**Client situation specialties**. You can become an expert in handling specific situations that call for specialized care and/or specialized knowledge. Some examples include distressed homeowners (short sales and pre-foreclosures), estate sales, first-time buyers, divorcing homeowners, relocations, retirees, military transfers, real estate investors, celebrities, government workers and home builders.&nbsp;

**Price Range specialties**. Your sphere of influence, client specialty or personal comfort level may have you gravitating towards entry-level homes, fixer-uppers, mid-market homes or luxury homes.

Remember that a niche, or specialty, should emphasize your strongest areas of expertise. If you are a new to the real estate business, specializing in a market area that you know well is a good start.&nbsp;

**Having a niche doesn’t mean you can’t sell other kinds of property, or represent clients from all walks of life.**&nbsp;But, it does allow you to focus on the lines of business that best leverage your interests and knowledge. Here’s an example:

If you are a city person who loves the energy and convenience of urban living, you may have natural enthusiasm for downtown condos. You may know the ins and outs of getting around using public transportation. You would probably have great recommendations for dining, entertainment and night life. You’d also know where the nearest medical center is located, along with other local details. This knowledge is an added value to your clients, who will appreciate your insights.&nbsp;

Your personal resources and sphere of influence should complement your niche. Otherwise, you’ll need to do some heavy networking in your preferred market. It may be wiser to “grow where you’re planted” in the beginning, gain some practical experience, and take incremental steps towards the direction you have in mind.&nbsp;

**Credentials count when establishing your niche**. You can build credentials with specialized training, mentoring and coursework. The National Association of REALTORS offers an array of professional designations and certifications.&nbsp;

Your personal, hands-on experience is even more valuable. If you want to specialize in newly-built homes, spend some time (with builder permission) on new construction job sites. Talk to general contractors about permits, timelines, materials, costs and challenges. You’ll get an earful.&nbsp;

If you want to help people avoid foreclosure, spend time talking to mortgage servicers about their short sale process and other foreclosure alternatives. Learn what the lender’s loss mitigation department does, and how to comply with their documentation requirements and timelines. You can also seek input from local housing counselors.

If your heart is with first-time buyers, be prepared to educate them about the home buying process. Collect information to share with them, such as down payment assistance programs. Have a network of mortgage lenders, home inspectors and contractors who are patient and willing to go the extra mile for newbie home buyers.

You get the idea\! Of course, you can conduct a Google search for an introduction to any topic, but there is no substitute for having personal contacts and resources.&nbsp;

**Working with a mentor can be an effective way to immerse yourself in a specialty.**&nbsp;You’ll get the advantage of hands-on learning, without the risks of trial-and-error that comes with going it alone.&nbsp;

One important caveat about a niche: don’t just chase the money. Do not choose your niche on something that is perceived as “easy” or the “biggest payday.” Sadly, there are articles all over place – by industry magazines – that tell you how smart it is to only sell luxury homes. The logic being, you’ll make just as much money selling 2 homes a year, as you would selling several smaller-priced homes. Double the money, and half the work, right?&nbsp;

There’s a huge problem with this thinking. First of all, if you are in this business to make a quick buck, you are in the wrong business. A specialty is one thing, but to discard business because it’s “too small” is unwise. You can have a niche, but cherry-picking your way through clients isn’t a realistic expectation. Nor is it the highest ethical practice.&nbsp;

Secondly, it takes much longer to sell an expensive home. In most areas, lower-priced homes sell more quickly than luxury homes. The higher up the price bracket you go, the longer the home will likely spend on the market. With high-end homes, you’ll be required to do more marketing for a longer period. This gets expensive fast. It isn’t impossible for a luxury home to spend a year or more on the market.&nbsp;

Imagine spending money on home staging consultants, virtual tours, professional photography, magazine ads, open houses and marketing on every website imaginable, and then the home still doesn’t sell…because it’s overpriced and the sellers won’t budge\! Then what? Typically, the sellers decide it’s your fault, pull the house of the market, and then later re-list with another agent.&nbsp;

This kind of thing happens all the time. Unless you take command during the listing appointment and set realistic expectations, you can find yourself in this spot. Luxury homes can be a lucrative niche – but they are not a lottery ticket.

**Know what you love about the real estate business, and choose your niche accordingly.**
