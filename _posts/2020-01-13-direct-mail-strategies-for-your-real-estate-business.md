While social media marketing and online advertising are important, direct mail marketing should be part of your arsenal\! Consider these points:

**Direct mail is tactile**. Your recipient will see and touch the mail you send. Even if they’re going to throw it away, they must handle each piece of mail and examine it. This makes it more memorable than emails or online advertisements, which are easier to discard without a glance.&nbsp;

**Direct mail is personal.** Direct mail enables your name, face and brand to enter the home of your recipient.&nbsp;

**Direct mail has a longer “shelf life” than online advertising**. An online ad can be scrolled past and ignored in seconds flat, but a piece of direct mail can stay in a household for days.

**Direct mail is cost-effective** when targeted properly – especially when you send postcards. The key is to make sure your contact list is up-to-date, and to use messaging that captures your recipient’s attention.&nbsp;

Here are more facts about direct mail:&nbsp;

**When it comes to direct mail, postcards are preferred by consumers.&nbsp;**According to the Direct Mail Association, 50.9% of surveyed consumers found postcard marketing pieces "useful." Information sent via postcard was deemed *more* useful than letter-sized pieces of mail, or mail sent in oversized envelopes. You don’t need to spend more to grab attention\!&nbsp;

**The average household receives 19 pieces of mail per week.&nbsp;**This is a drop in the bucket compared to the countless number of emails, social media ads and online ads the average household gets in a single day\! Direct mail has much less “noise” to get through. &nbsp;

Now, let’s look at how you can use direct mail for your real estate marketing.&nbsp;

**1\. Thank-you cards or notes.** If you do nothing else with direct mail in your real estate business, be sure to send sincere thank-you’s when appropriate. Examples include:

* Thank you to clients for listing appointments (follow-up)&nbsp;
* Thank you to clients for choosing you as their agent for buying/selling a home&nbsp;
* Thank you to past clients and associates for new client referrals&nbsp;
* Thank you to peers and associates for home showings, open house assistance, ect.&nbsp;
* Thank you to mentors, coaches, professional network partners or brokers who provided meaningful support&nbsp;

**Showing sincere gratitude and appreciation is always worth the effort.** Not only does this make you memorable, it makes the recipient happy they helped you. They will be more inclined to help you in the future, and do business with you again\!&nbsp;

**2\. Market updates.** Homeowners and renters alike are interested in market directions. If rents or home prices are going up, down or sideways, they want to know\!&nbsp;

**3\. Local tax rates, special assessments and property assessment news.** Property assessments are often misunderstood. If you are comfortable explaining how these work, you can be a welcome fount of knowledge for homeowners. Get in front of upcoming assessment or tax rate changes and offer assistance. &nbsp;

**4\. Upcoming open houses.** These don’t have to be your listings\! Check for upcoming open houses on the MLS. Offer prospective buyers to join you on a tour of homes.&nbsp;

**5\. New listings.** If you don’t have listings of your own to announce, you can still leverage new listings in the area. Let recipients know there are “x” number of homes available in a specific price range, and offer to set up their personal tours.&nbsp;

**6\. Just sold.** If you lack sales of your own, then capitalize on recent sold properties as local market news.&nbsp;

**7\. Announce your appearance at local events.** If you are holding a seminar, participating in a fundraiser, or participating in the local trade show, tell people about it\! Give them a reason to stop by and say hello, too.

**8\. Free market value consultation or home buying consultation.** Don’t follow what every other agent says, however. Make your message distinct and targeted, like: “Buyers are looking in Pine Grove\! Call for your home value analysis and learn how to improve your sales price\!”

**9\. Personal, non-marketing message**. Remember past clients and professional partners on their birthdays, home purchase anniversaries or other personal milestones. Holiday cards are another option.&nbsp;

**10\. Personal announcement about yourself**. This includes announcements about changing brokerages, or alerting recipients about any change to your contact information. It’s also appropriate for sharing professional milestones.&nbsp;

You can probably think of more reasons to send direct mail, but this gives you a good start\!&nbsp;

Next, let’s talk about how often direct mail should be used. You can send messages monthly, quarterly, or intermittently.&nbsp;

**Monthly direct mail campaigns** have two drawbacks: in time, they can become expensive to maintain, and some recipients could view the clockwork regularity as junk mail. However, monthly mailings give your name and brand the best reinforcement, and the frequency allows you to try a variety of messaging.&nbsp;

**Quarterly direct mail campaigns** have the advantage of being scheduled and budgeted in advance, like a monthly campaign, but at a fraction of the cost. The downside: they are not as effective for staying top-of-mind, especially if your competitors are sending monthly campaigns to the same prospects.

**Intermittent direct email campaigns** are surgical-strike missions. These are meant to capitalize on trending market activity, local news and events, and specific opportunities. The downside is, you must quickly craft your message, produce your postcard and get it in the mail in a timely fashion. Because this strategy relies on highly-customized messaging and timing, it can be very cost-effective, while being useful and memorable to recipients.&nbsp;

There are more considerations about direct mail. Postcards and letterheads must be professional. If you’re not much of a writer, you might seek the services of a copywriter or marketing service. There are all-in-one solutions available as well as ala-carte options. I’ll be happy to share my advice\!
