There’s an old saying among real estate brokers: “You have to list to exist.” It’s difficult to run a profitable real estate business if you don’t have listings of your own.&nbsp;

In fact, the main reason why the top 10% of real estate agents make 90% of the money is because they dominate the real estate listings in their markets.&nbsp;

Whenyou hold a listing, you’ll have agents bringing buyers through the door and bringing offers to your table\! But without any listings of your own, you’ll be doing a lot of legwork with a smaller chance of seeing a commission.&nbsp;

The more seller leads you have, the greater your chances for listings and commissions\!&nbsp;

**Finding potential home sellers is as easy as 1, 2, 3.**

New agents tend to overthink this process\! You don’t need to spend a fortune buying leads from third-party websites. Here’s what you do need:

1\. A professional website with a good lead-capture page. Lead capture pages include compelling offers such as a free market value analysis or home selling guide in return for an email address and basic contact info.&nbsp;

2\. Access to property tax information or other real estate records in your market. If you want to find sellers, start by knowing who the homeowners are\! Once you have a homeowner list, you can use direct mail campaigns, door-knocking or cold-calling to approach these prospects.&nbsp;

3\. A lead management system. *There is nothing more costly than having leads fall through the cracks.* Whether you track your leads on an Excel spreadsheet or mobile app, keep it well-maintained.&nbsp;

**There are two basic types of seller leads:**

* Those that come to you passively, through personal referrals, your website, or social media pages

* Those that you obtain through your own active marketing and networking efforts

As a new agent, you can expect to work hard for your seller leads. The good news is that by earning these leads with your own efforts and systems, you’ll quickly learn what works – and what doesn’t. As you obtain clients and close transactions, you’ll eventually be rewarded with personal referrals, and you’ll find passive leads easier to attract\!

Next, let’s talk about organizing your leads\!&nbsp;

**When you talk to potential sellers, your objective is to learn how motivated they are.** You’re not trying to push anyone\! Your seller leads can be organized in three basic groups:

**1\. Ready to list.** These are your priority leads, or your “A” list. These clients have a timeframe already in mind, and their home is prepared for the market. They are actively looking for market value estimates and the right agent to help them.

**2\. Almost ready to list.** These are your “B” list leads who aren’t quite ready for the market, but have made the decision to sell. They are very open to information and guidance, but have something holding them back. Their barriers could include a property condition issue, a financial issue, a personal issue, adverse market conditions, or a lack of information.&nbsp;

**3\. “Someday” sellers.&nbsp;** These are your “C” list leads who expect to move at some unidentified point in the future. They may be casually interested in market information, but aren’t motivated to sell.&nbsp;

As you can guess, your focus should be on “A” list prospects\! Your goals here are simple:

* Obtain the listing appointment

* Obtain the listing\!

Next are your “B” list prospects. This is where many agents drop the ball, because these leads require less work, yet these are highly-convertible leads for those willing to invest the effort. You should be contacting your B-list leads once a month. Your goals:

* Stay top-of-mind

* Find out what’s holding them back from selling

* Address those concerns honestly and pragmatically&nbsp;

* Obtain the listing appointment

* Obtain the listing\!&nbsp;

Finally, we have the C-list leads. These can be diamonds in the rough, but don’t hold your breath\! You should contact them quarterly. Your goals:

* Stay top-of-mind. They may have family or friends to refer to you\!&nbsp;

* Learn what motivates them when they think about selling.&nbsp;

* Move them to the B-list\!
