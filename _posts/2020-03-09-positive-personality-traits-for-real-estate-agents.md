Unfortunately, in our age of social media, we’ve learned to let memes, “Like” buttons and emoji handle our communication. Interpersonal skills are becoming a lost art\!

The ability to be likable, and to hold a genuine, face-to-face conversation, is a must for any real estate agent. I have 3 golden rules to help you\!

\*\*1. Be your best self. \*\*

Psychology studies have shown that *authenticity* is a key to earning trust. When people try to act like someone they’re not, they come across as nervous or suspicious.

When you are your authentic self, you’ll naturally be more confident and relaxed. So will your clients\! So, go ahead, wear a polo shirt and slacks instead of a suit. Look and sound like *you*.

Yet, as a new agent, you might find yourself trying to put on an impression that fits your new *real estate pro* image. This facade seldom works because clients see right through it.

Think about the times you’ve spent interacting with new car salespeople, insurance salespeople, mortgage lenders or other professionals. Think about the professionals you found authentic, and the people who didn’t impress you.

It usually comes down to personality and how someone presents themselves. If you like someone, you’re apt to do business with them\!

With this in mind, if you are genuinely enthused about helping others, and you have a passion for real estate, you’re off to a good start\!

\*\*2. Cultivate desirable traits. Discard bad habits. \*\*

There are several traits that send clients running away:

* Poor self-esteem
* Indecisive
* Short attention span – forgetful or unfocused
* Arrogance
* Judgmental
* Pushy
* Untruthful
* Negative or discouraging
* Sloppy

We all know people with one or more of these traits. We may have one or two of these traits ourselves. Work on self-improvement where it’s needed. Being human is a continual growth process\!

**Traits that attract clients:**

* Confidence
* Openness/friendliness
* Approachable
* Calm
* Positive attitude
* Knowledgeable
* Committed
* Honest
* Organized

Being “knowledgeable,” means doing your homework before your client appointments\! Be informed about market conditions and economic trends. Know what’s going on in your community. Be informed about new developments, local amenities and so on.

\*\*3. Listen more than you speak. \*\*

New agents can be so busy trying to win business that they dominate the conversation, spending the whole appointment talking about themselves\!

*Focus on the client.* It’s why you’re there\!

When meeting with your client, take notes on your mobile device or with pen and paper. This gives you something to do other than talk\! It helps you focus on the issues important to your client. Plus, you’ll look like a genius to them when you remember all these details in the future.

During the conversation, occasionally paraphrase what your client says. Repeat their priorities back to them using your own words.

Ask a few questions. It proves you’re interested in them and their situation. (Don’t drive them crazy with needless questions, however.)

Eye contact should be made throughout the conversation. Break it once in a while when you’re taking notes, or when you need to think for a moment.

**Superstar Agent Tips\!**

* Smile when you say hello. Smile again when you say goodbye\!
* Say what you mean, and do what you say. Demonstrate integrity in all matters.
* Be a proactive communicator.
* Treat each client’s home with care and respect. Some of the most-loved homes are humble abodes.
* Do not make promises you can’t keep. You’ll exhaust yourself, disappoint your client, and damage your reputation.
* Under-promise and over-deliver. Find ways to make your clients say “Wow\!”
* Begin and end conversations on a positive note whenever possible.
