Leveraging technology helps you build a profitable real estate business! But with so many apps to choose from, where do you start? You might already have more apps on your phone than you ever use. So before we dive into my list of essential apps, here are three tips that will help you use them as effectively as possible:

1. Remove the apps you never use. Clean house on your smartphone! Visual clutter makes it harder to find the go-to apps that you need the most. 

2. Set a monthly technology budget within your business expense budget. In some cases, an app itself is free, or has a free trial, but then a monthly cost applies. It’s easy to rack up several monthly app fees before you know it, so choose wisely! 

3. Choose apps that best solve ongoing issues that you’re likely to face in your business. Keep your bottom line in mind. Ask yourself: “Will this app allow me to give better service to my clients? Will this app save me money? Will it help me make money? Will it help me stay top-of-mind with my clients?”<br>Here is the list of apps that I’ve put together. This isn’t all-inclusive, but they’re good, practical apps that most real estate agents will find beneficial. 

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/mobile?trigger=on){: target="_blank"}: This cloud-based service stores, synchronizes, and shares files from your smartphone, PC, and tablet. It allows users to scan and store contact lists, contracts, appraisals, and more —  including PDFs, Word documents, and spreadsheets, as well as listing photos, Adobe files, videos, and other relevant files. This app is a great way to save important client and property information on the go. A basic account with 2 GB of storage is free.

[Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/){: target="_blank"}: A must-have for agents in the digital age, this app allows you to upload and send documents for signature. You can also send reminders and verify signing status anytime. NAR members can get a [discounted subscription](https://go.docusign.com/nar/){: target="_blank"}.

[Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/){: target="_blank"}: Scan business expense receipts using your smartphone using this app, which codes and categorizes expenditures for you. This makes for easy itemization come tax time. Plus, it can track business miles using GPS technology. The app is free to download, but a small monthly fee does apply. 

[Inkly](https://www.inkly.com/){: target="_blank"}: Mail greeting cards and thank-you cards to clients using this app. It uses your own handwriting! Write your message on a piece of paper, snap a photo of it with your smartphone, and upload to Inkly. Inkly prints it on quality cardstock and mails it for you. 

[Magicplan](https://www.magicplan.app/){: target="_blank"}: Create floor plans and virtual tours using your smartphone. You can also create 3-D floorplans! Monthly fees vary according to the type of account you choose. 

**One last tip**: Pick one app today, and practice using it. Once you’re comfortable with it, incorporate it into your business routine! After you've mastered your first app, you can begin using others (one at a time) and establish proficiency with each of them over time.

But remember when using these apps to keep their monthly fees, as well as their terms of use and cancellation policies, in mind.
